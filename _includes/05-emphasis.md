I have a **BA in Neuroscience** and a **Master's in Neuroimaging and Informatics**. <br>
My current position requires a lot of *organization* and *management of large datasets*. I am currently working to improve my programming skills in order to perform tasks more *efficiently*, which has been fun!

**I have experience in these programming languages:**
- *python*
- *bash*
- *matlab*
- *LaTeX*
- *C*
- *R*
